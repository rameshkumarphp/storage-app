# Simple and Secured Storage application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Docker is also configured to simplify the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run

### `docker-compose build`

First let's build the Docker image from the Dockerfile by running the docker-compose build command.

Use `docker images` to verify whether image is built successfully.

### `docker-compose up`

Run the docker-compose up command to start the container. The React development server will be running inside the container and will be watching the src folder. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### `npm start`

Alternatively you can use npm start to run the application in development environment.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
